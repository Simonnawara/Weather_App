<h1>Weather App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a simple HTML/JavaScript script that shows the user the weather conditions anywhere in the world. The utility allows you to select any city or country to display the real-time temperature, humidity and wind speed.
The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data, and updating the UI accordingly.
